    ### How the score is calculated
    The user engagement score is calculated based on several criteria related to the driver's gaze:
    
    - **Road Focus**: Time spent focusing on the road is considered positive.
    - **Mirror Check**: Time spent checking mirrors is considered positive if within a threshold.
    - **Dashboard Check**: Time spent checking the dashboard is considered positive if within a threshold.
    - **Off Road Gaze**: Time spent looking away from the road is considered negative.
    - **Prolonged Check**: Prolonged checks are considered negative if exceeding a threshold.
    - **Closed Eyes**: Time spent with eyes closed is always negative.
    
    Each gaze direction is scored, and the overall engagement score is calculated as a percentage.
